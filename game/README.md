## AI Disclaimer
Very limited parts of this project, such as handling multi-word names (e.g., "rusty cog", "metal door"), were modified with the assistance of AI tools. The AI helped generate a checker loop that validates the order of words in these names, ensuring that commands are parsed correctly. These contributions were used solely to fix specific issues in our existing code rather than to create the project from scratch. Every effort was made to ensure accuracy and quality.

Enjoy the adventure! üóùÔ∏è‚ú®
